#PolyHacks 2017 App
Work in progress, may eat your cat

##TODO
- Make a map of the IST
- Decide on a license

##Build Instructions
(First time only)

`npm install`

`ionic add platform $platform_of_choice`

(after the first time)

`ionic build $platform_of_choice`

`ionic run $platform_of_choice`

(for quick debugging)

`ionic serve`

(this just runs the app on your computer and lets you play with it in the browser)
