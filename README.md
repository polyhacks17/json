#PolyHacks 2017 App
:construction::rotating_light: Work in progress, may eat your cat :rotating_light::construction:

##TODO
- Remove all placeholders, replace with actual stuff
- Re-make the app for Android and iOS _(we murdered Cordova and have to start from scratch. Yes, it's that bad)_

##Build Instructions :wrench:
- Load up the project in Android Studio
- Build
- Profit?
